# Telegraph

A python project that listens for SMTP connections and prints them to my thermal printer.

HTML rendering is provided by Weasyprint.

Images are also supported when served over HTTP or Base64 encoded. Attached images also work with Cotent-Id headers.

Send me a message on any platform if you wish to have the details to send stuff to my printer.
