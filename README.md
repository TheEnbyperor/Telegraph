# Telegraph

A python project that listens for SMTP connections and prints them to my thermal printer.

Basic HTML formatting is supported:
* \<b\>
* \<u\>
* \<i\>

Images are also supported when served over HTTP or Base64 encoded. Attached images do not work (yet).

Send me a message on any platform if you wish to have the details.
